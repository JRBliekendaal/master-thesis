\section{Literature found after 2020)}
\label{sec:literaturefoundafter2020}
Before selecting possible attributes a new search for literature was conducted with the terms as defined in \cref{sub:literaturestudy} for the concepts \gls{antifragile} and \acrshort{ea}. The search was conducted in a specific time frame. The time frame was set from 2020 to March 2022. This time frame was chosen to only search for literature that is released after the research period of \textcite{Botjes2020}. Thirty-one new articles, books and in-proceedings where found that could be of interest. For more information see Appendix~\ref{app:literaturecatchup}. Of those thirty-three new sources, three where already in the current set of literature, eight where not found or where not publicly available, thirteen where not relevant. Seven possible new sources where selected. From those seven some where not relevant or just partially.

From the seven that where left the following literature is selected for further study:
