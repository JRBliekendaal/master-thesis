I do believe you should never stop learning. When you stop learning, you will stop developing yourself while your life and profession are changing continuously. That is why I am always following an education, professional training or reading books on various subjects. A couple of years ago, I made plans to pursue a bachelor's degree in Business\&IT. At that time, I had classes on Enterprise Engineering. A study of eighteen weeks on Design \& Engineering Methodology for Organisations. At the end of the first day, we had a flash visit from Hans Mulder, who drove by after giving a masterclass at the Nyenrode Business University. Hans told us that the Bachelor's track I was following was the perfect preparation for the Executive Master of Enterprise IT Architecture at the Antwerp Management School. At that moment, I had never heard of the Antwerp Management School, and I even was surprised that there was an educational track for architecture. During studying for my Bachelor's degree, I visited an introduction evening at Antwerp Management School for more information. After my visit, I knew it for sure. 

I still remember what Steven de Haes (the dean of the Antwerp Management School) told us during the opening seminar at Corsendonk (BE). Studying at the AMS will be a life-changing experience. It did not feel that way in the first two years. COVID-19 happened, and classes onsite were impossible. Everything was online after Corsendonk.



While doing research and writing this thesis I discovered that I have found out how little that I actually know.
