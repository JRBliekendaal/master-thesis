\section{Validation through an artefact}
Because there is not much known on the applicability of antifragile on Enterprise Architecture, the success factors need to be validated to be true. To validate, the researcher will create an artefact. The Delphi Research Method is used to validate the artefact. By validating the artefact, the researcher can ensure that the success factors are valid with some degree of certainty.\\

Quote from AMS011:\\
''The whole is different from the sum of its parts and their interactions'' [61] (p.77) Though emergence, the whole cannog be reduced to the original parts, the whole is considered a new entity or unit. The whole is ''qualitativly different from their parts ... The cannot be meaningfully compared-they are different'' [61] (system holism)
