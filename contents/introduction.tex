\label{ch:introduction}
The Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said that one constant since the beginning of time is change. However, the fear of change is also a constant.  His central claim is summed up in the phrase Panta Rhei ("life is flux"), recognising life's essential, underlying essence as change. Nothing in life is permanent, nor can it be, because the very nature of existence is change. Since times immemorial, humans have liked routine, making us feel in control of our lives. When that fear of change becomes irrational, our ability to control it becomes a phobia, particularly Metathesiophobia. A Metathesiophobe feels they have no control over their lives due to constant change. Metathesiophobes tend to live in the past and are unwilling to progress, often leading to depression, seriously impacting their professional and personal lives. If a society or country rejects the change, there is no growth and no progress. The inability to change, progress, or grow can result in stagnation. Stagnation rejects realising ones full potential. Stagnation is not a healthy flowing river; it is an idle and stale pond. \parencite{Mark2010, Arapahoe2020}

A world that is continuously in flux is a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous world. According to \textcite{Bennett2014} the world of \acrshort{vuca} requires a new approach. Disintermediation, globalisation, market upheaval, disruption, and technological advance all combine to produce an effect that is difficult to mitigate,  impossible to predict, and arduous to detect \parencite[p. 885]{OReilly2019}. \textcite{Taleb2008} his definition of a black swan (see later in this chapter) is similar. To deal with the \acrshort{vuca} world, companies invested a great deal of time and money in becoming less \gls{fragile} by being more \gls{robust} and \gls{resilient}. However, \textcite{Taleb2012} claims by being more \gls{robust}, or \gls{resilient}, the company can only withstand the change but does not gain from it.

\textcite{Taleb2012} defines the opposite state of \gls{fragile}, \gls{antifragile} as an answer to what \textcite{Taleb2008} calls black swan events. \textcite{Taleb2012} states that \gls{resilient}, \gls{robust} (and company) are states that neither breaks nor improves. \textcite{Taleb2012} claims that \gls{antifragile} is the state that gains and improves. \Gls{antifragile} is the true opposite of \gls{fragile}.

In this thesis, I define the \acrfull{ea} success factors for contribution to become \gls{antifragile}. I use the boundary of the local governmental agencies of the public sector as my lens.

\section{The author}
\label{sec:context}
I am working as a Chief Architect for an \acrfull{isv} delivering products and services to the local governmental agencies in The Netherlands, such as municipalities, the local tax offices, and the social services. I am responsible for the architecture function in this company.

\section{The structure of this thesis}
\label{sec:structure}
In \cref{ch:introduction}, the context of the research is set, the core concepts of \acrshort{ea} and \glspl{antifragile} are introduced together with the contextual boundary of the public sector. This chapter is closed with the problem statement, the belonging research questions, and the substantiation of the relevance of this research. In \cref{ch:theoreticalbackground}, the background on the concepts is given. The lens of the public sector is defined. The concepts of \acrshort{ea}, \gls{antifragile}, and other relevant concepts such as system, organisation, and stressor are researched and defined. \cref{ch:research-methodology} explains the used research methodology and the approach for the research based on the FAIR\footnote{\url{https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/}} principles and the research properties of replicability, falsification, independence, and precision as described by \textcite{Recker2013}. \cref{ch:eaafsuccessfactors} is used to gather success factors. The success factors are extended with possible implementation guidelines from an \acrshort{ea} perspective. \cref{ch:eaafsuccessfactors} ends with an overview of found success factors of \acrshort{ea} and \gls{antifragile} that can contribute to the public sector to become \gls{antifragile}. In \cref{ch:delphi} the Delphi method is used to refine, validate, and extend the success factors. By using triangulation the success factors are weighted and screened to determine the final success factors. In \cref{ch:conclusionanddiscussions} the conclusion of this research is stated, discussions are started and recommendations are given. \cref{ch:retrospective} is the retrospective on the research and its process.

\section{Introduction of the public sector}
\label{sec:intropublicsector}
According to \textcite{PrivacySense2016} the public sector is comprised of organisations that are owned and operated by the government and exist to provide services for its citizens. Similar to the non-profit sector, organisations in the public sector do not seek to generate a profit. The public sector is divided into three levels \parencite{PrivacySense2016}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{The national government,} such as the military, the tax authority, and homeland affairs.}
	\item{\textbf{The regional government,} such as the provinces, the police, and water management.}
	\item{\textbf{The local government,} such as the municipalities, the social services, and the local tax offices.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction of the concept Enterprise Architecture}
\label{introea}

\textcite[p. 104]{Lapalme2016} says that \acrshort{ea} should be understood as being constituted of the essential elements of a socio-technical organization, their relationships to each other and to their changing environment as well as the principles of the organisation’s design and evolution. Enterprise architecture management is the continuous practice of describing and updating the EA in order to understand complexity and manage change. Frameworks are often used for describing the \acrshort{ea}. Most of the frameworks use a layered approach for specific viewpoints on a system. The most used layers are business, information, applications, and technology. \textcite[p. 189]{Ylimaeki2005} suggests that \acrshort{ea} is an approach for controlling the complexity and constant changes in the business environment of an organization, enabling a real alignment between the business vision, business requirements and information systems.

\section{Introduction of the concept of antifragility}
\label{sec:introantifragility}
\textcite{Taleb2008} describes a black swan as an event that 1) is so rare that even the possibility that it might occur is unknown, 2) has a catastrophic impact when it does occur, and 3) is explained in hindsight as if it were actually predictable. For extremely rare events, \citeauthor{Taleb2008} argues that the standard tools of probability and prediction, such as the normal distribution, do not apply since they depend on large population and past sample sizes that are never available for rare events by definition. Extrapolating, using statistics based on observations of past events is not helpful for predicting black swans, and might even make us more vulnerable to them. In his book \Gls{antifragile}, \textcite{Taleb2012} states that the way to survive a black swan event is to be \gls{antifragile}.

Most people answer that the opposite of \gls{fragile} is \gls{robust}, \gls{resilient}, solid, or something of the sort. However, the \gls{resilient}, \gls{robust} (and company) are items that neither break nor improve, so you would not need to write anything on them — have you ever seen a package with \gls{robust} in thick green letters stamped on it? Logically, the exact opposite of a \gls{fragile} parcel would be a package on which one has written, please mishandle or please handle carelessly. Its contents would not just be unbreakable but would benefit from shocks and a wide array of trauma \parencite{Taleb2012}. \textcite[p. 32]{Botjes2020} mentions that almost all if not all papers on antifragility and resilience use the term stressor for an event
from outside the system, that causes stress.

\end{figure}

\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:problemstatement}
The concept of \gls{antifragility} implies that organisations could benefit and strengthen from crises, volatility, errors and uncertainty and could also lead to opportunities for innovation \parencite{Kastner2017}. \acrshort{ea} is a discipline that helps organisations to reach their goals. As described in \cref{introea} with \acrshort{ea} one would expect that an organisation uses \acrshort{ea} to get more towards the state of \gls{antifragility}. Research has been conducted on aspect architectures such as the application and information architectures but not on \acrshort{ea}. The problem is that the \acrlong{bok} contains no direct knowledge on how to achieve \gls{antifragility} with the use of \acrshort{ea}. 

\section{The research subject}
\label{sec:researchsubject}
\acrshort{ea} facilitates an organisation in assessing the impact of change and making recommendations for target states that support business objectives. \acrshort{ea} guides an organisation in changing. \acrshort{ea} can help organisations in changing towards the state of \gls{antifragility}.

As described in \ref{introea} \acrshort{ea} is used to steer an system towards its goals. However, what are the success factors of \acrshort{ea} that contribute in accomplishing \gls{antifragility}? This is summarised in a conceptual research model.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/conceptualmodel}
	\caption[Conceptual Research Model]{Conceptual Research Model}
	\label{fig:conceptualmodel}
\end{figure}

The hypothesis of the conceptual research model is that, in the context of the system public sector, \acrlong{ea} success factors have a positive influence in the contribution of \acrlong{ea} in achieving antifragility in that system. From this conceptual research model the research question can be stated as:\bigskip

\noindent \emph{''What are the success factors of \acrlong{ea} for \gls{antifragility} in the public sector?''}\bigskip

\noindent To correctly answer this research question the following sub-questions need to be answered:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{What is literature saying about the public sector?}
	\item{What is literature saying about \acrlong{ea}?}
	\item{What is literature saying about the success factors of Enterprise Architecture?}
	\item{What does literature say about antifragile?}
%	\item{How can the success factors of \acrlong{ea} contribute to becoming antifragile?}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Research relevance}
\label{sec:researchrelevance}

\acrshort{ea} has contributed to being more \gls{robust}, \gls{resilient}, and \gls{agile}. Using \acrshort{ea} in pursuing \gls{antifragility} will add value to companies by accelerating and growing when there is a stressor or black swan event. The \gls{antifragile} theory is young.  \citeauthor{Taleb2012} published the theory in his book ''\Gls{antifragile}: Things that gain from disorder.'' in \citeyear{Taleb2012}.  Studies conducted on \acrshort{ea} with the concept of \gls{antifragile} are almost non-existence. The conducted studies are primarily about making IT Systems \gls{antifragile}. \textcite{Botjes2020,Kastner2017} are exceptions and have researched how to apply \gls{antifragile} in an organisational context. Nevertheless, both concluded that there is more research needed. The former used the lens of Enterprise Engineering, which is closely related to \acrshort{ea}, together with resilience, while the latter used mostly complex adaptive system resilience as its lens. There is still no answer to how \acrshort{ea} can contribute to becoming \gls{antifragile}. Giving more insights on this subject will contribute to the \acrshort{bok} and help others getting closer to \gls{antifragility} by using \acrshort{ea}.

	\label{fig:publicstressors}
\end{figure}

Because of the \gls{digitaltransformation}, the pace of change is increasing rapidly.  The \gls{digitaltransformation} is not the only stressor on the public sector. There are a lot of internal and external stressors. The public sector invested a lot in being less fragile by becoming more agile, robust, and resilient. By being more robust, or resilient, you can only withstand the change or the stressor but you do not gain from it. Governmental agencies in the public sector are searching for methods of dealing with this increased pace and the stressors that occur. The relevance of this research is not only about the addition to the \acrshort{bok} but also to share the outcome with the public sector.
