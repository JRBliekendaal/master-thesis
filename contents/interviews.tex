\chapter{Interviews}
\label{ch:interviews}
This chapter contains the approach and the outcome of the interviews with C-level executives of the \gls{ps}. For the interviews, four executives were invited. The executives were carefully selected to have a balance in the scope of the \gls{ps}.

The purpose of the interviews was to research the state of \gls{antifragility} and \acrshort{ea} in the \gls{ps}. Since interviews are under a time constraint, it was not possible to talk about every \gls{attribute} separately. Because of this, the research questions were created based on themes. The themes were carefully selected to make sure that there is a possibility that the \glspl{attribute} are mentioned in the conversation. Fore more information on how the themes are connected to the \glspl{attribute} see Appendix~\ref{app:cmapinterviewattributes}. Because the interviews were at C-level, the interviews were not in-depth. It was not possible to talk in-depth about the attributes of \acrshort{ea}. One C-level interviewee became even irritated with a simple question on \acrshort{ea}. Because of this, the interviews are analysed on the schools of thought \parencite{Lapalme2012} of \acrshort{ea}. The attributes are implicitly part of that particular school of thought based on the answers. \cref{tab:interviewquestions} contains the questions that were asked during the interviews. An interview lasted approximately one full hour. The interviews were recorded and automatically transcribed (in Dutch). The interviewee gave consent for the recording and transcription. It is not possible to make the recordings and the transcriptions anonymous to be part of the publicly available data set. In place of sharing the recordings and the transcriptions, the thesis has summaries of the interviews attached. See Appendix~\ref{app:interviewsummaries} for these summaries. The Antwerp Management School can request the recordings and transcriptions only for (re)accreditations and visitations to enable the Antwerp Management School to comply with statutory obligations.

\section{Interview results}
After the interviews \acrfull{qda} took place. For \acrshort{qda}, the transcriptions of the interviews were used and coded with labels. A label was created for every positive and negative version of an \gls{attribute} (\gls{antifragile} and no \gls{antifragile}). While doing the \acrshort{qda} possible new \glspl{attribute} are discovered. Labels are also created for these new attributes. After coding analysis was started. The data set of this analysis is available as a structured Microsoft Excel workbook with multiple worksheets. This file is available in the GitHub repository of this research\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JRBliekendaal/master-thesis/blob/main/datasets/interviews/raw_interview_data_and_charts.xlsx}}. The interview results are discussed through a description supported by a set of graphs. One graph is the number of times an \gls{attribute} was mentioned, the frequency, and the other graph is the percentage of the interviews in which this was mentioned, \% of Cases. The discussion will take place based on the earlier defined categories \gls{attenuatevariety}, \gls{amplifyvariety}, Learning organisation and the \acrlong{ea} schools of thought. The charts have to be read as if a \gls{attribute} scores positive the \gls{attribute} is present. When the an \gls{attribute} scores negatively the \gls{attribute} is not present or is missed. This mean, based on the used data set, that the \gls{attribute} could be a success factor.

Why \textit{\gls{topdowncc}} and \textit{\gls{micromanagement}} scored highly is because the governments in the \gls{ps} have a severe risk-avoiding attitude. Everything must be predefined and planned. There must be accountability for how public money is spent. All missteps are magnified. There is a quick result in crises, but with possible consequences later on because of \acrfull{bit} audits or \glspl{parliamentaryinquiry}. The reflex on \gls{uncertainty} of the \gls{ps} is that the \gls{ps} gets very insecure from \gls{uncertainty}. The \gls{ps} does not know how to deal with \gls{uncertainty}. The common reflex is to push the \gls{uncertainty} back to certainty, so it is under
control again. E.g. a missing law with the introduction of electric steps. It is not a bike, not a motorcycle or a car. The electric step did not fit into the current laws and regulations. The result was that the policymakers did not approve it and did not even tolerate it until law-making finished. \Gls{modularity} and \gls{looselycoupled} both scored a bit because the \gls{ps} consists out of a lot of subsystems. Every subsystem has a clear goal and a reason to exist. Communication between subsystems are going through standardised interfaces and are predictable.

One interviewee stated that the \gls{ps} should be in a permanent crisis situation to get things done.

The end goal is not very clear with \gls{agile} working. It is unclear how the public money is spent on precisely what. 



There is no risk appetite. Everything must be known and explainable in advance. If it is found that the procedures are not used, it can result in political consequences later on. Afterwards, positive lessons learned are not used to make adjustments within the public sector. Experimentation is (almost) not possible.

What we have to do in the public sector depends on the political decision making within the period of governing (four years until new elections). \acrshort{ea} is at the end of the chain of administrative decision-making.
