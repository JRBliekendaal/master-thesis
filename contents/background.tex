\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:theoreticalbackground}
This research uses three main concepts of interest: \textit{the \gls{ps}}, \textit{\gls{antifragile}}, and \textit{\gls{ea}}. Understanding the interpretation of these concepts is essential for a \gls{sharedmentalmodel}. Besides the three main concepts, it is vital to understand the concept system. The three main concepts use \textit{system} as a concept. The concepts \textit{\gls{ps}}, \textit{\gls{antifragile}}, \textit{\gls{ea}}, and \textit{system} are defined for a \gls{sharedmentalmodel}.
\section{System}
\label{sec:tbsystem}
Literature often uses the concept of system but with a different meaning \parencite[p.~37]{Lapalme2012}. System is used for many different things like software applications, interrelated people, systems of numerous interrelated elements (economical, social, technological) and others.

System has various definitions and types. E.g. open and closed, linear and non-linear, dynamic and deterministic systems \parencite{Rickles2007}. A system can be an area of interest \parencite[p.~13]{Mannaert2016}. However, with another definition, a system is an object that is studied in the field \parencite[p.~933]{Rickles2007}. Both definitions are similar. \Textcite[pp.~13--14]{Mannaert2016} acknowledged that the system is not isolated. The system of concern and systems in the environment have interactions. This behaviour is what \textcite[p.~32]{Bertalanffy1968} calls an open system. An open system is a system that exchanges matter with its environment, as where a closed system is considered to be isolated from its environment \parencite[p.~39]{Bertalanffy1968}.

A system is more than the sum of its parts. It is an indivisible whole \parencites[p.~51--69]{Ackoff1964}[p.~664]{Ackoff1973}. A system loses its essential properties when taken apart. The elements of a system can also themselves be systems. Every system can be a part of another system. These systems are also called sub-systems. This managerial idea of systems thinking is to focus on the interactions of the parts rather than their behaviour separately. 

A mental model to understand a system is dependent on specific characteristics of the behaviour of a system. Understanding the behaviour of a system can only be in its environment \parencite[p.~29]{Gharajedaghi2011}. The boundary of a system is defined by the variables that can be influenced or controlled by the actors of that system \parencite[p.~182]{Gharajedaghi2011}. Variables that can not be influenced or controlled but impact the viability of the system are part of the context \parencite[p.~183]{Gharajedaghi2011} or the environment \parencite[p.~13--14]{Mannaert2016}. The \textit{Why they do} and \textit{What they do} of the actors in the environment help with influencing the environment \parencite[p.~33]{Gharajedaghi2011}. To understand the inner workings, ''one needs the ability to see complementary relations in opposing tendencies and to create feasible wholes with infeasible parts'' \parencite[p.~38]{Gharajedaghi2011}. However, the properties of a system are not the properties of its parts but that of the whole \parencites{Ackoff1973}{Gharajedaghi2011}. Because of these properties, actions intended to produce the desired outcome may generate opposite results, resulting in counter-intuitive behaviour \parencite[p.~48]{Gharajedaghi2011}.

The concepts of the \gls{ps}, \gls{ea} and \gls{antifragility} use different \glspl{specialisation} of the concept system. These \glspl{specialisation} are \textit{\gls{sos}}, \textit{\gls{sie}}, and \textit{Ecosystem}.
\subsection{System-of-Systems and System-in-Environment}
\label{sub:tbsysofsys}
A collection of independent systems that are part of a more extensive system has unique capabilities \parencite{INCOSE2018}. The independent systems working together have unique behaviour that they do not have on their own.  A \gls{sos} is composed of multiple systems \parencites{Ackoff1973}{Gharajedaghi2011}. Another variation is that of a \gls{sie}. Using \gls{sie} stresses that a system is part of and should be aware of its environment \parencites{Gharajedaghi2011}{Lapalme2012}{Korhonen2016}{Mannaert2016}. \gls{sie} is a means to enforce environmental learning. With environmental learning, an enterprise adapts its desired goals to be more compatible with its environment \parencite[p.~41]{Lapalme2012}. The definitions of \gls{sos} and \gls{sie} are within the general definition of a system previously defined by \textcites{Ackoff1973}[p.~183]{Gharajedaghi2011}[pp.~13--14]{Mannaert2016}.

\subsection{Ecosystem}
\label{sub:tbecosystem}
The concept of ecosystem originated from the field of ecology. It was firstly defined by \textcite[p.~229]{Tansley1935} \parencite[p.~19]{Rich1988}. ''But the more fundamental conception is, as it seems to me, the whole system (in the sense of physics), including not only the organism-complex but also the whole complex of physical factors in the widest sense'', is the ecosystem as defined by \textcite[p.~299]{Tansley1935}. There are multiple transfers of the ecological ecosystem concept onto additional domains \parencite[p.~3]{Guggenberger2020}. A company must be viewed not as a member of a single industry but as part of a business ecosystem that crosses a variety of industries \parencite[p.~76]{Moore1993}. A business ecosystem is a concept that various businesses form value creation networks together \parencite[p.~3]{Guggenberger2020}. Ecosystems can be described as ''a set of actors with varying degrees of multilateral, non-generic complementarities that are not fully hierarchically controlled'' \parencite[p.~2255]{Jacobides2018}. There are different ways to order kinds of ecosystems. One way is that of dividing ecosystems into five specialisations. Business ecosystem \parencite[p.~76]{Moore1993}, platform ecosystem \parencite[p.~5]{Guggenberger2020}, service ecosystem \parencites{Barros2006}{Papazoglou2006}{Huang2014}, innovation ecosystem \parencites{Iansiti2004}{Carayannis2009}{Gomes2018}, and software ecosystem \parencites{Manikas2013}[p.~5]{Guggenberger2020}.

\section{Antifragile}
\label{sec:tbantifragile}
What is \gls{antifragile}, where did it originate, what can you achieve with it, and why is \gls{antifragile} important? These questions are the first things that come to mind when hearing \gls{antifragile} for the first time.

Publications on the subject of \gls{antifragile} often use \textit{\gls{stressor}} \parencite[p.~32]{Botjes2020}. What is a \textit{\gls{stressor}}? \textcite[p.~23]{Ghasemi2017} defined \textit{\gls{stressor}} based on \textcites{TurnerII2003}{Chrousos2009} as ''When systems are performing effectively, they are in a predetermined condition and conversely when they are not functioning correctly, they are in an unintended state. An unintended condition can be known or unknown. \textit{\Glspl{stressor}} are forces that threaten to transfer a system from an intended to an unintended condition.''

\Gls{antifragile} originated from the domain of risk management. \Gls{antifragile} was coined for the first time by \textcite{Taleb2012} as his answer to \glspl{blackswan}. \Glspl{blackswan} are ''large-scale unpredictable, and rare events of massive consequences'' \parencite[pp.~6--7]{Taleb2012}. The rarer the event, the less manageable, and the less we know about the frequent of its occurrence. The odds of \gls{blackswan} are not computable. ''Given the unattainability of perfect robustness, we need a mechanism by which the system regenerates itself continuously by using, rather than suffering from, random events, unpredictable shocks, \glspl{stressor}, and \gls{volatility}''. With random events \gls{robust} is not good enough. Everything with the most minute vulnerability breaks. \Gls{robustness} cannot just be it, perfect \gls{robustness} is needed not to end up crashing the system.'' \parencite[p.~8]{Taleb2012}. \Gls{fragile} systems fail when exposed to \glspl{stressor} \parencite[p.~21]{Ghasemi2017}. However, \gls{antifragile} systems prosper and improve in response to unpredictability, \gls{volatile}, randomness, chaos and disturbance (\cref{fig:eaal-triad}). \Gls{antifragility} goes beyond \gls{robustness}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/eaal-triad}
	\caption[Triad of fragile, robust, and antifragile \parencite{Botjes2021}]{Triad of fragile, robust, and antifragile \parencite{Botjes2021}}
	\label{fig:eaal-triad}
\end{figure}
\Gls{antifragile} means that a system gains more than it loses. Reducing possible losses will reduce the harmful effects of exposure to damaging elements such as \glspl{stressor} and \gls{blackswan} \parencite[p.~932]{Russo2017}. Positive asymmetry\footnote{Positive asymmetry happens when you have a lot of upside and little downside. Negative asymmetry is when you have little upside and high downside.} is achievable by reducing possible losses. ''\Gls{fragility} and \gls{antifragility} mean potential gain or harm from exposure to something related to \gls{volatility}.'' \parencite[p.~13]{Taleb2012}. That something is what \textcite[p.~13]{Taleb2012} calls a member of the extended disorder family. This disorder family consists of \gls{uncertainty}, variability, imperfect, incomplete knowledge, chance, chaos, \gls{volatility}, disorder, \gls{entropy}, time, the unknown, randomness, turmoil, \glspl{stressor}, error, dispersion of outcomes, unknowledged. The disorder family is interpreted by \textcite[p.~12]{Botjes2020}, based on the works of \textcites[p.~436]{Taleb2012}[p.~3]{Gorgeon2015}, as \acrlong{vuca} from \textcite{Bennis1985}. \Gls{antifragility} is not only an answer to a \gls{blackswan} but also to random events, unpredictable shocks, \glspl{stressor}, and \gls{volatility} \parencite[p.~8]{Taleb2012}.

\subsection{Antifragile as a system property}
\label{sub:backgroundafpropertyofsystem}
A diversity of researchers define that \gls{fragility}, \gls{robustness} and \gls{antifragility} are properties of a system \parencites{Jaaron2014}{Hole2016}{Kastner2017}{OReilly2019}{Botjes2021}. \Gls{selforganisation}, ownership, \gls{diversity}, \glspl{sharedmentalmodel} and a shared vision are some of the properties that an \gls{antifragile} system should posses. \textcite{Botjes2021} conducted extensive research to define \gls{antifragility} and the application of \gls{antifragility} on organisation design. \citeauthor{Botjes2021} used multiple sources (\cref{tab:tbsourcesofantifragileattributes}) to define a list of attributes.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{@{}p{.4\textwidth}p{.4\textwidth}@{}}
		\toprule
		\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Sources}} \\%
		\midrule

		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}%
	\caption[Sources used for antifragile attributes \parencite{Botjes2021}]{Sources used for antifragile attributes \parencite{Botjes2021}}
	\label{tab:tbsourcesofantifragileattributes}%
\end{table}%
The result is the \acrfull{eaal} (\cref{fig:eaalbw}). The \acrfull{eaal} is recent. \textcite[p.~5]{Botjes2021} created the data set through extensive literature research, but the data set only covers literature until June 2019. 
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/eaalbw}
	\caption[Extended Antifragile Attribute List \parencite{Botjes2021}]{Extended Antifragile Attribute List \Parencite{Botjes2021}}
	\label{fig:eaalbw}
\end{figure}
Searching for \textit{new} literature makes sure that \textcite{Botjes2021} is recent and is not rebutted. Using the time frame of June 2019 until April 2022 makes sure that only new literature is found. We used the same academic search engines and keywords as \textcite[p.~5]{Botjes2021}. The result of the search was \textit{thirty-one} new sources. These sources are new articles, books and in-proceedings (\cref{app:literaturecatchup}). We rated the new findings on accessability, if it was already part of \textcite{Botjes2021}, and if the sources contained information on properties and attributes of \gls{antifragility}. Of those thirty-one new sources, three were already in the literature set of \textcite{Botjes2021}. Eight were not found or publicly available, and thirteen were not relevant. Only seven were of interest to look at. After reading them, none of the literature added something new or rebutted the work of \textcite{Botjes2021}. \textcite{Botjes2021} is recent and contains possible \glspl{attribute} to become more \gls{antifragile} in the Dutch \gls{ps}.

The \acrlong{eaal} (\cref{fig:eaalbw}) classifies \glspl{attribute} in two primary and five secondary categories. \textit{\Gls{attenuatevariety}} and \textit{\gls{amplifyvariety}} (\cref{sub:attenuatevsaplify}) are the two primary categories. The five secondary categories are \textit{\gls{engineeringresilience}}, \textit{\gls{systemsresilience}}, \textit{\gls{casresilience}} (\cref{sub:tbresilience}), \textit{\gls{antifragile}} and \textit{learning organisation} (\cref{sub:learningorganisation}). The \acrlong{eaal} does not contain resilience as a secondary category but multiple types of resilience. The \acrlong{eaal} assigned the secondary categories to the primary categories. \textit{\Gls{engineeringresilience}} and \textit{\gls{systemsresilience}} are assigned to \textit{\gls{attenuatevariety}}, while \textit{\gls{casresilience}} and \textit{\gls{antifragile}} to \textit{\gls{amplifyvariety}}. \textit{Learning organisation} is the only category assigned to both \textit{\gls{attenuatevariety}} and \textit{\gls{amplifyvariety}}.
\subsection{Resilience}
\label{sub:tbresilience}
\Gls{resiliency} is mentioned often in relation to \gls{antifragility}. \textcites[loc.~280]{Kastner2017}[p.~3]{Botjes2021} uses the definitions of \textcite[pp.~5--8]{MartinBreen2011}. \textcite[pp.~5--8]{MartinBreen2011} identified several types of resiliency. These types are  \textit{\gls{engineeringresilience}} (Common Sense resilience), \textit{\gls{systemsresilience}} (Robustness in economics), and \textit{\gls{casresilience}}. The definitions of \gls{resiliency} (\cref{tab:resiliencetypes}) have focus on the avoidance of harmful \glspl{stressor} and failure, including \gls{uncertainty} and \gls{volatility} \parencite[pp.~5--8]{MartinBreen2011}.
\begin{longtable}{p{.3\textwidth}p{.55\textwidth}}

	\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Description} \\%

	\Gls{systemsresilience} & Maintaining system function in the event of a disturbance. Systems resilience has been applied in governance and management, where it is often called robustness. \\%
	\Gls{casresilience} & The ability to withstand, recover from, and reorganise in repsonse to crisis. The function is maintained by the system structure may not be. The main differentiator is the adaptive capacity or adaptability of the system.\\%
	\bottomrule%
\end{longtable}
\subsection{Learning organisation}
\label{sub:learningorganisation}
One of the secondary categories of \acrlong{eaal} is learning organisation. But what is the learning organisation? The learning organisation is a way to create resilient organisations. These resilient organisations can cope better with unknown and unpredictable evens. ''Continuous improvement requires commitment to learning.'' \parencite{Garvin1993}. The learning organisation is an organisation that is equipped for creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge \parencite{Garvin1993}. The result of this is that a learning organisation can modify its behaviour to reflect new knowledge and insights \parencite{Garvin1993}. \textcite{Senge1994} defined the \glspl{attribute} of the learning organisation that \textcite{Botjes2021} used in the \acrlong{eaal} (\cref{fig:fithdiscipline}). These attributes are \textit{\gls{personalmastery}}, \textit{\glspl{sharedmentalmodel}}, \textit{\gls{buildingsharedvision}}, \textit{\gls{teamlearning}}, and \textit{\gls{systemsthinking}}.

	\caption[The Fifth discipline \parencite{Senge1994}]{The Fifth discipline \parencite{Senge1994}}
	\label{fig:fithdiscipline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Attenuate variety and amplified variety}
\label{sub:attenuatevsaplify}
The two main categories in the \acrlong{eaal} are \gls{attenuatevariety} and \gls{amplifyvariety}. What is \gls{attenuatevariety} and \gls{amplifyvariety}? Variety originated from Cybernetics and was coined by \textcite{Ashby1956}. Variety denotes the count of states of a system. \citeauthor{Ashby1956} and \citeauthor{Beer1979} stated the Law of Requisite Variety as 'variety can destroy variety ' \parencite[p.~207]{Ashby1956} and 'variety absorbs variety' \parencite[p.~286]{Beer1979}. ''If a system is to be stable, the number of states of its control mechanism must be greater than or equal to the number of states in the system being controlled.'' \parencite{Heylighen2001}. There are two types of variety manipulations \parencites{Ashby1956}{Beer1979}. \Gls{attenuatevariety} is reducing the variety in a system, while \gls{amplifyvariety} is increasing the variety in a system. ''To amplify internal variety is about increasing the chance of a higher \gls{entropy} and, therefore, more capable of absorbing the increasing external variety caused by change.'' \parencite[p.~4]{Botjes2021}. \Gls{attenuatevariety} is about increasing the chance of a lower \gls{entropy} and, therefore, less capable of absorbing increasing external variety caused by change. \Gls{engineeringresilience} and \gls{systemsresilience} are results from \gls{attenuatevariety}, while \gls{casresilience} and \gls{antifragile} of \gls{amplifyvariety}. Another interpretation is possible. \Gls{attenuatevariety} increases the \gls{fragility} of a system, while \gls{amplifyvariety} decreases the \gls{fragility} and increases the \gls{antifragility} of a system.
\subsection{Is agility antifragility?}
\label{tb:antifragile_vs_agility}
In the introduction on \gls{antifragility} (\cref{sec:introantifragility}) we mentioned that \textcite[pp.~79--81]{Steen2018} recognised \gls{fragility}, \gls{robustness}, \gls{resiliency}, \gls{agility}, and \gls{antifragility} as manifestations of \textcite{Taleb2012}. Nevertheless, \gls{agility} is not used, or in some cases mentioned, by \textcites{Taleb2012}{Kastner2017}{OReilly2019}{Botjes2021} and others.

What is the relation between \gls{agile} and \gls{antifragile}? Is \gls{agile} \gls{fragile}, \gls{robust} or \gls{antifragile}? The question is \gls{agile} \gls{fragile}, \gls{robust} or \gls{antifragile} is improperly framed \parencite[p.~6]{Tomov2019}. \Gls{agility} can be \gls{fragile}, \gls{robust} or \gls{antifragile}. \Gls{antifragility} and \gls{robustness} are mathematically defined as properties, while \gls{agility} is not. Rather than aiming to control or remove control, we have to build technical and business systems that aim to be \gls{antifragile} to change \parencite[p.~884]{OReilly2019}. When we architect \gls{antifragility}, businesses can gain \gls{agility}. When we build systems that aim to be \gls{antifragile} for change is better than to control change. The result is the possibility of creating business and technical architectures that enable \gls{agility} through design.

Based on experiences and observations, five trademarks and twenty-three practices are defined for organisational agility \parencite[p.~7]{Aghina2018}. When we combine these trademarks and practices with the \acrlong{eaal} from \textcite[p.~7]{Botjes2021} it is clear that by using the attributes from the \acrlong{eaal} it is possible to achieve \gls{agility} in a system. \Gls{agility} can be the result of applying \gls{antifragile} \glspl{attribute}. \Gls{agility} is a result of implementation, while \gls{antifragile} is a property of a system.
\subsection{Antifragile system attributes}
\label{sub:attributesofantifragile}
The \acrlong{eaal} is selected as a source and starting point for \gls{antifragile} attributes (\cref{sub:backgroundafpropertyofsystem}). \Gls{optionality} is stated as an essential attribute by \textcites{Taleb2012}[p.~64]{Botjes2020}. \Gls{optionality} is excluded from the \acrlong{eaal} because of the overlap with \gls{diversity} \parencite[p.~64]{Botjes2020}. But \textcites{Taleb2012}[p.~9]{Gorgeon2015} both use the term \gls{optionality}. \Gls{optionality} is an idea advanced by \textcite{Taleb2012}. At the most basic level, \gls{optionality} means having lots of options. The difference between \gls{optionality} and \gls{diversity} is very subtle. \Gls{optionality} allows the buyer to retain the upper bound and be unaffected by adverse outcomes which makes the buyer \gls{antifragile} \parencite{Cunff2020}. Despite the minimal difference between \gls{optionality} and \gls{diversity}, \gls{optionality} can still have a distinctive character in the Dutch \gls{ps}. Adding \gls{optionality} to the already defined set of the \acrlong{eaal} brings a total of twenty-three attributes. The \acrlong{eaal} categorised the attributes into \gls{attenuatevariety}, \gls{amplifyvariety}, and \gls{learningorganisation}. Adding \gls{optionality} to \gls{amplifyvariety} makes it equal to \gls{diversity}. For the overview of the \glspl{attribute} for \gls{antifragile} see \cref{tab:attributesofantifragile}.

\section{Public sector}
\label{sec:tbpublicsector}
The context of this research is the public sector. We need to explain the Dutch \gls{ps} to have a common understanding that will help to place this research in its proper context. However, we will not explain how the Dutch \gls{ps} functions in depth.

In general the \gls{ps} is the collective name for all government and semi-government organisations \parencite[p.~261]{Pathirane1982}. We divide the governments into three levels: the national government, the regional government, and the local government. We see these levels also in the Dutch \gls{ps}: the central government, the provinces, and the municipalities \parencite[p.~10]{Libert2016}. The Netherlands is a decentralised unitary state. A decentralised unitary state is a form of government in which territorial units within a unitary state have independent powers \parencite[p.~8]{Engels2013}. The organisation of local and regional authorities is formalised in the Netherlands by the Provinces Act and the Municipalities Act. Provinces and municipalities can therefore decide on issues themselves. There is no fixed demarcation of tasks between the levels of the government. Nevertheless, provinces and municipalities have a general power to regulate and manage, which can only be limited by law. However, provinces and municipalities are obliged to cooperate in implementing rules set by higher authorities.

My observation is that, as a result, there are differences in the implementation of laws between municipalities themselves. E.g. one municipality is helping residents get financially healthier by coaching, while another municipality is employing them. In both cases it is about a law for social benefits performed by municipalities. In theory you can have \underline{n} different implementations of the law with \underline{n} being the number of municipalities.

The central government is the part of the government that works at the national level \parencite{Rijksoverheid2019}. They are responsible for policy-making, passing laws and monitoring compliance. In addition, the central government is responsible for preparing plans for the government and parliament and carrying out these plans.  The provinces can decide independently on many matters. E.g. the creation of new nature and building new roads. In addition, the provinces also implement several national laws. Municipalities only perform tasks that are of direct importance to their residents. Making those choices is the essential task of a municipal council. In addition, the municipalities also implement many national laws. For example, every municipality must issue passports and identity cards to its residents. 

As of 2022, the national government consists of 12 ministries \parencite{Linthorst2021}, the regional government of 12 provinces \parencite{CBS2022prov}, and the local government of 344 municipalities \parencite{CBS2022prov}. Organisations that are part of the public sector but are not classified as an organisation belonging to one of the three levels are excluded from this count. 

A difference between the public sector and other sectors is public accountability. Public accountability is a form of accountability that relates specifically to the public sector \parencite{Boers2009}. Public accountability should be distinguished from public responsibilities, which involve a substantive discussion about the public sector's tasks, obligations, and liabilities. Public accountability relates to public funds' expenditure and the exercise of public duties and powers. It is transparent for the public, and it is from the public good perspective. You see this also when you compare the public and private sectors on core values. Public accountability is the most important value in the public sector, while profitability is almost non-existing \parencite[p.~472]{Wal2008}. The top five public sector core values are accountability, effectiveness, incorruptibility, reliability, and lawfulness.

\subsection{The public sector as a system}
\label{sub:tbpssystemofsystems}
In general, the Dutch \gls{ps} is the collective name for all government and semi-government organisations \parencite[p.~261]{Pathirane1982}. Besides the central government, provinces, and municipalities, we also have semi-government organisations that are part of the public sector. An organisation is part of the semi-government if the government finances it, performs public tasks, and serves a public good. Examples of semi-government organisations are the organisations of public transportation, healthcare, and education. When we use the theory of systems (\cref{sec:tbsystem}) we can say that the public sector is a System of Systems. But is it correct that the sub-systems are only government and semi-government organisations?

The \gls{ps} is working closely together with the private sector in so-called Public-Private Partnerships. A Public-Private Partnership is when the government and the industry work together to realise a project based on a clear division of tasks and risks \parencite[p.~8]{Enneman2007}. While at the same time retaining their own identities and responsibilities. A Public-Private Partnership realises added value---a qualitative better product for the same investment or the same quality for a lower investment. Besides the Public-Private Partnership, you see also other forms of collaboration. Like collaborations in innovations. ''By working together with private companies and start-ups and learning from each other, we will develop new innovative solutions \parencite[p.~120]{Digitaleoverheid2021}. ''We can also give others the space to innovate public services, for example, by releasing open data (under conditions) so that large and small companies can develop so-called 'gov tech' solutions. The government does not always have to do this innovation itself or have it commissioned.'' \parencite[p.~120]{Digitaleoverheid2021}. "Only through cooperation within the government and the business community, education and science can we strengthen technological developments." \parencite[p.~68]{Digitaleoverheid2021}.

The role of private sector organisations is changing more and more. \Glspl{jv} are formed between public and private sector organisations in stead of private sector organisations only delivering products and services to the \gls{ps}. Can the Dutch \gls{ps} reach its goal of being more responsive and adaptive to respond more adequately and flexible to unforeseen circumstances without the private sector? We have the opinion that they cannot. There are many dependencies and there is a high interconnectedness (coherency). We decided to place the private sector organisations working with the Dutch \gls{ps} in the \gls{sos} of the Dutch \gls{ps} (\cref{fig:pssystemofsystems}).

\section{Enterprise Architecture}
\label{sec:tbenterprisearchitecture}
This research is about which success factors positively influence \gls{ea} in achieving \gls{antifragility} in the Dutch \gls{ps}. This statement already assumes that \gls{ea} is a means to achieve a goal. Is this correct? Does the world have the same idea about \gls{ea}, or do they see it differently? Can \gls{ea} contribute to reaching the goals of an organisation or even a system? Regardless of the attention \gls{ea} gets, many researchers and practitioners have indicated that there is a lack of a shared mental model \parencite[p.~2]{SaintLouis2019}. The various definitions are not always complimentary, and sometimes they are even opposite \parencites{Dietz2008}{Hoogervorst2009}{Lapalme2012}{SaintLouis2019}. ''Unfortunately, the term ''Enterprise Architecture'' has many meanings as well, meanings that are quite diverse and sometimes even contradictory.'' \parencite[p.~51]{Dietz2008}. A lens on Enterprise Architecture needs to be defined for this research to create a shared understanding of Enterprise Architecture. There is no shared mental model of Enterprise Architecture \parencite[p.~2]{SaintLouis2019}. The lack of a shared mental model can create confusion and conflicts concerning the purpose of Enterprise Architecture and its practice \parencite[p.~1]{SaintLouis2019}. The definitions vary in the scope of application. Some definitions only focus on \acrlong{it} systems, while others focus on the business, the enterprise, the environment, or any other combination. E.g. the definitions from \textcites{Gartner}{Dietz2008}{Graves2009}{Ross2014}{White2018}.
\vskip\baselineskip
\noindent \underline{Definition of \textcite{Gartner}}: \gls{ea} analyses the execution of change toward a desired business vision and outcomes. \gls{ea} leads the enterprise proactively and holistically, responding to disruptive forces.
\vskip\baselineskip
\noindent \underline{Definition of \textcite[p.~53]{Dietz2008}}: Theoretical, architecture is the normative restriction of design freedom. Practically, architecture is a consistent and coherent set of design principles.
\vskip\baselineskip
\noindent \underline{Definition of \textcite[pp.~4--5]{Graves2009}}: \gls{ea} is a discipline through which an Enterprise can identify, develop and manage its knowledge of its purpose, its structure and itself. \gls{ea} will also assist in managing changes imposed on the organisation by the market, by regulations, or -- at an operations level -- by system failures, environmental incidents or customer complaints.
\vskip\baselineskip
\noindent \underline{Definition of \textcite[p.~9]{Ross2014}}: \gls{ea} is the organising logic for business processes and IT infrastructure, reflecting its operating model's integration and standardisation requirements. It provides a long term view of a company's processes, systems and technologies so that individuals can build capabilities and not just fulfil immediate needs.
\vskip\baselineskip
\noindent \underline{Definition of \textcite{White2018}}: \gls{ea} is the process by which organizations standardize and organize IT infrastructure to aligns with business goals. These strategies support digital transformation, IT growth and the modernization of IT as a department. \gls{ea} is the practice of analysing, designing, planning and implementing enterprise analysis to successfully execute on business strategies. \gls{ea} helps to lay out how information, business and technology flow together.
\vskip\baselineskip
Four out of five definitions are mostly about deterministic blueprinting. The only definition that is different is that of \textcite{Dietz2008}. The definition of \textcite{Dietz2008} is more about emerging architecture. We also see another difference. With the first four definitions the outcome of the architecture is often the architecture product itself while with \textcite{Dietz2008} the ''architecture is not what you see but what shaped what you see.''. All five \gls{ea} definitions provide decision-support for direction and change at any level of the enterprise. E.g. ''The choices in the journey of an enterprise for an executive, the preferred technologies or process models for new developments for programme and portfolio management, as well planning when to decommission, change or replace systems'' \parencite[p.~4]{Graves2009}. The real difference between the definitions is that the definition of \textcite{Dietz2008} only limits the design freedom by defining boundaries while the other definitions are more deterministic and intended. Because a shared mental model is absent, there is also no clear approach to practising \gls{ea} \parencite[p.~2]{SaintLouis2019}.
\subsection{Approaches of Enterprise Architecture}
\label{sub:eaapproaches}
There are several perspectives on the practice of \gls{ea} \parencites{Lapalme2012}{Kotusev2015}{Ylinen2018}{Ylinen2020}. One of the perspectives is an approach that distinguishes two groups of \gls{ea} experts. A modelling-focused group forms a comprehensive view of an organisation, and a development-focused group using \gls{ea} for organisational development \parencites[p.~6]{Ylinen2020}. 

However, another perspective distinguished three approaches \parencite[p.~4071]{Kotusev2015}. The traditional \parencite{Spewak1993}, the \acrfull{mit} \parencite{Ross2014}, and the \acrfull{dya} \parencite{Wagter2005} approach \parencite[pp.~4071--4072]{Kotusev2015} (\cref{tab:tbthreeapproaches}).

	\label{tab:tbthreeapproaches}
	\endlastfoot%
	Traditional & A four-step sequential process. Document the current (as-is, baseline) state, develop the desired future (to-be, future) state and the transition plan to migrate from the current to the target state, and implement the plan and repeat the process. \\%
	\acrshort{mit} & Advocates the development of a long-term enterprise-level architectural vision to be translated into concrete project-level decisions through IT governance mechanisms. These decisions involve business and IT managers on different organisational levels. \\%
	\acrshort{dya} & ''Just enough, just in time'' architecture. The development of \gls{ea} starts no earlier than there is a need for it. Business initiatives trigger the activities of 
	\gls{ea} to make sure that needed projects fit nicely into the existing \gls{ea} and in the strategic plans of the enterprise. \\%
	\bottomrule%
\end{longtable}
When you scrutinise the definitions of the three approaches, it becomes clear that the approaches are focused on organisations and not the environment. The \gls{ea} three schools of thought from \textcite{Lapalme2012} gives another perspective. Three possible schools of thought in the practice of \gls{ea} are, \gls{enterpriseitarchitecting}, \gls{enterpriseintegrating}, and \gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation} \parencite[pp.~38--41]{Lapalme2012} (\cref{tab:tbschoolsofthought,app:easchoolsproperties}).

	\label{tab:tbschoolsofthought}
	\endlastfoot%
	\gls{enterpriseitarchitecting} & \gls{ea} is the glue between business and IT. \gls{ea} is an enabler for executing the business strategy. This school is about aligning an enterprise's IT assets to execute business strategy effectively and various operations using the proper IT capabilities. The school \gls{enterpriseitarchitecting} focuses on the \acrlong{it} capabilities while not questioning the business capabilities. \\%
	\gls{enterpriseintegrating} & \gls{enterpriseintegrating} links strategy and execution. It is not only enabling enterprise strategy it also implements it. Designing all the organisational dimensions is fostered with systems thinking. \gls{enterpriseintegrating} is aware of its environment and tries to manage the environment. \\%
	\gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation} & \gls{ea} fosters organisational learning by designing all facets of the enterprise. It changes the environment and systematically designs the enterprise, including its relationship to the environment. The enterprise's relationship to its environment is an indisputably connected facet. This school of thought enables innovation and \gls{sie} adaptation. It looks for bidirectional incoherence between the enterprise and its environment. Nevertheless, it is the means for organisational innovation and sustainability. It is about enterprise and environment co-evolution. \\%

\subsection{Defining a lens on Enterprise Architecture}
\label{sub:definingea}
\Gls{antifragile} deals with \glspl{stressor} and \glspl{blackswan} originating from the (environment of the) system of interest. The \acrlong{eaal} of \textcite{Botjes2021} fosters \gls{organisationallearning} and \gls{systemsthinking} capabilities to deal with \glspl{stressor} and \glspl{blackswan} \parencite[pp.~2--4]{Botjes2021}. Exploring the \gls{ea} schools of thought \parencite{Lapalme2012} makes it clear that \textit{\gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation}} is probably the best school in the context of \gls{antifragility}. \textit{\gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation}} has a clear focus on the environment, fosters organisational and \gls{environmentallearning}, and embraces \gls{systemsthinking} \parencite[pp.~40--41]{Lapalme2012}. Although the school \textit{\gls{enterpriseintegrating}} already has the notion of the environment, it is not changing the environment like the school \textit{\gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation}}. At the same time, \textit{\gls{enterpriseitarchitecting}} has its main focus on the IT organisation of the enterprise itself. If an organisation want to survive in the turbulence of today's markets, the organisation must learn to adapt and innovate \parencite[p.~42]{Lapalme2012}. The school \textit{\gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation}} is about adapt and innovate.

It is still necessary to define the lens we use on \gls{ea}. The lens on \gls{ea} is partly defined. \textit{'The how'} is known. The \gls{ea} school of thought \gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation} is selected. The properties of this school are known (\cref{sec:propeea}). We still miss the definition of \gls{ea}. \textit{'The what'} that we will use as a lens. \textcite[p~42]{Lapalme2012} mapped \gls{ea} authors and literature to the three schools of thought (\cref{app:easchoolsresearchers}).

\end{table}
A lens on \gls{ea} must be aligned with the \gls{ea} school of thought of \gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation}. But the definition should also support the Dutch \gls{ps} in being more adequate and flexible to unforeseen circumstances, and so \gls{antifragile}. Using the list of authors and sources for the school of thought of \gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation} (\cref{tab:eeaauthors}) shows that two sources contain definitions of \gls{ea}. The first source that contains a definition is \textcite{Hoogervorst2009}. \textcite[p.~8]{Hoogervorst2009} defines \gls{ea} as something that provides normative guidance for design in order for the enterprise to operate satisfied. \gls{ea} comprises four sets of architecture business, organisation, information, and technology.

The second is that of \textcite{Graves2008}. ''\gls{ea} is the integration of everything the enterprise is and does.'' \parencite[p.~1]{Graves2008}. \gls{ea} is about the structure of the whole of the enterprise—the whole rather than a single sub-system. There are no simple states of 'as is' and 'to be'. The world is dynamic and not static. Everything in a business system depends on everything else \parencite[p.~14]{Graves2008}.

\citeauthor{Graves2008}'s definition directly relates to the \gls{ea} school of thought of \gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation} and hints towards \gls{antifragility}. But its \gls{ea} is still mostly normative and deterministic. When we compare this with the definition of \gls{ea} from \textcite{Dietz2008} is the definition of \citeauthor{Dietz2008} more emergent. It will adapt easier to unforeseen circumstances. The definition of \textcite{Dietz2008} has a downside. It can be too conceptual to use it correctly but ''it seems to be the only feasible way of ‘translating’ high-level statements, as can be found in mission and strategy documents, into operationally useful principles for the development of systems.'' \parencite[p.~53]{Dietz2008}. We decided to adopt the definition of \textcite{Dietz2008} as our lens.

\subsection{Enterprise Architecture system attributes}
\label{sub:attributesonea}
The \gls{ea} school of thought of Enterprise Ecological Adaptation has the best alignment with \gls{antifragile} (\cref{sec:tbenterprisearchitecture}). The \glspl{attribute} used for \gls{ea} will be those of the school of \gls{enterpriseecologicaladaptation}.  It contains \glspl{attribute} related to learning and \gls{systemsthinking}. \textit{\Gls{organisationallearning}}, \textit{\gls{environmentallearning}}, and \textit{\gls{systeminenvironmentcoevolutionlearning}} are related to learning and \textit{\gls{systeminenvironment}}, \textit{\gls{holisticsystemicstance}}, and \textit{\gls{intraorganisationalcoherency}} to \gls{systemsthinking}. See for a full overview \cref{tab:attributesofeea}.
