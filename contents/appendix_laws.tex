\section{2\textsuperscript{nd} Law of Thermodynamics}
\label{sec:appendix2ndlawthermodynamics}
The ‘2\textsuperscript{nd} Law’ was formulated after nineteenth century engineers noticed that heat cannot pass from a colder body to a warmer body by itself. It states that in any closed system the amount of order can never increase, only decrease over time. Another way of saying this is that entropy always increases.
