\chapter{Properties of the Enterprise Architecture schools of thought}
\label{app:easchoolsproperties}
This appendix describes the Enterprise Architecture school of thoughts in more details. It will help the reader with detailed understanding of the three schools of thought.
\section{The properties of Enterprise IT Architecting}
The school of thought \gls{enterpriseitarchitecting} \parencite[p. 39]{Lapalme2012} is summarised in the following table.
\begin{table}[!h]
	\begin{center}
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
			\begin{tabular}{@{}p{.2\textwidth}p{.8\textwidth}@{}}
				\toprule%
				& \textbf{Enterprise IT Architecting school of thought} \\%
				\midrule%
				Motto    		& Enterprise architecture is the glue between business \& IT \\
				Objectives and 	& Effectively enable the enterprise strategy \\
				concerns		& Support IT planning and reduce cost \\
				& Enable business \\
				Principles and  & Apply reductionist (mechanistic) stance \\
				assumptions		& Don't question business strategies  \\
				& Design organisational dimensions independently \\
				& Don't worry about non-IT dimensions; they are not your concerns \\
				Skills 			& Have technical competence and engineering knowledge \\
				Challenges		& Convince the organisation to accept the designed plans \\
				Insights		& Permits the design of robust and complex technological solutions \\
				& Fosters the creation of high-quality models and planning scenarios \\
				Limitation		& Can produce inadequate or unfeasible solutions for the larger organizational context \\
				& Struggles with solution acceptance and implementation barriers \\
				& Susceptible to “perfect” designs 	that support unsustainable strategies \\
