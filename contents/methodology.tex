\section{Research Model}
\label{sec:researchmodel}
This section describes the research steps of the research. The detailed information on how these steps are operationalised are part of, \cref{sec:researchapproach}. \cref{fig:research-model} gives an overview on the steps that are taken to answer the main research question, \cref{sec:introresearchquestion}.

To answer the sub-questions and the main research question literature research has a central part in the approach. The research starts with a literature study on the concepts of systems, the \gls{ps}, \gls{antifragile}, and \acrfull{ea}. The goal of this step is to define the concepts and search for attributes that can possible be a success factor. The output with be analysed and possible success factors are determined. The outcome of this analysis will be validated by interviews. The interviews are analysed to validate the possible success factors and possible new success factors. The outcome will be validated by an Expert Group. After the validation by the expert group the final analysis will take place before conclusions are taken and a discussion on the outcome will take place.
\section{Research approach}
\label{sec:researchapproach}
This section elaborates on the detailed approach of the research.
\subsection{Literature study}
\label{sub:literaturestudy}
For the literature research two primary methods are used. The first method is (forward and backward) snowballing of already acquired and found literature. In the literature administration it is easy to recognize snowballing by using the column \textit{Found at}, see \cref{sub:tbresearchexecution}. The second method is the use of online scientific libraries.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption[Snowballing literature]{Snowballing literature \parencite{Wohlin2014}}
	\label{fig:snowball}
\end{figure}
For finding relevant literature online scientific libraries are used. The online scientific libraries are Web of Science, Research Gate, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar. The full concept name is used and the known abbreviations of the concept (e.g. Enterprise Architecture and EA). Literature is only accepted if the literature complies with quality attributes. These attributes are accuracy, authority, objectivity, currency, and coverage\footnote{\url{https://libguides.library.cityu.edu.hk/litreview/evaluating-sources/}}. All found literature is administrated for replicability, independence, precision, accessibility, and reusability. Section \ref{sub:tbresearchexecution} describes how literature registration and administration is executed.
\subsubsection{System}
\label{subsub:system}
For the literature study on system two primary sources are used. The first is that of \textcite{Ackoff1973} with the title \citetitle{Ackoff1973} and the second is that of \textcite{Gharajedaghi2011} with the title of \citetitle{Gharajedaghi2011}. \citeauthor{Ackoff1973} is one of the original researchers on the subject of systems while \citeauthor{Gharajedaghi2011} is and a follower of \citeauthor{Ackoff1973} and is one of the authors that is noticed by \textcite[p.~42]{Lapalme2012} to be one of the authors following the \acrshort{ea} school of thought of \acrshort{eea}, see \cref{tab:eeaauthors}. The first method for literature study is snowballing. Snowballing of these sources is used to determine other important literature on the concept of system. The second method for literature study is the use of online scientific libraries. For these libraries the following set of keywords or key sentences are used.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\textwidth}p{0.4\textwidth}}
		\toprule
		system & \acrlong{sos} \\%
		\acrlong{sie} & ecosystem \\%
		\gls{antifragile} system & \acrlong{ea} system \\%
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption[System keywords]{System keywords}
	\label{tab:systemkeywords}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{Antifragile}
\label{subsub:antifragile}
The literature study on \gls{antifragile} makes use of four primary sources. The first primary source is the book \citetitle{Taleb2012} from \citeauthor{Taleb2012}. \citeauthor{Taleb2012} is the progenitor of the \gls{antifragile} theory. The second primary source is the book \citetitle{Taleb2008} from \citeauthor{Taleb2008}. \citetitle{Taleb2012} is the answer to \citetitle{Taleb2008}. The third primary source is the master thesis \citetitle{Botjes2020} by \citeauthor{Botjes2020}. \textcite{Botjes2020} contains an extensive study of literature in the field of \gls{antifragile} and the context of an organisation. By using the thesis of \citeauthor{Botjes2020} the literature study of this research can concentrate on the literature that was released after 2020. \citeauthor{Botjes2021} published a paper on the same subject named \citetitle{Botjes2021}. This paper is the fourth primary resource. The last primary resource is that of the article \citetitle{OReilly2019} by \textcite{OReilly2019}. \textcite{Botjes2020} did not use the articles of \citeauthor{OReilly2019}. The articles of \citeauthor{OReilly2019} were less of interest for the subject of \citeauthor{Botjes2020}. While for the current research \textcite{OReilly2019} has added value since it targets system architecture.

The first method for literature study is snowballing. Snowballing of these sources is used to determine other important literature on \gls{antifragile}. Forward snowballing is used for the source of \citeauthor{Taleb2012}. Since \citeauthor{Taleb2012} is the progenitor, it is not necessary to do a backward snowballing. Backward snowballing is used for the sources from \citeauthor{Botjes2020} and \citeauthor{OReilly2019}. The second method for literature study is the use of online scientific libraries. For these libraries the following set of keywords or key sentences are used.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\textwidth}p{0.4\textwidth}}
		\toprule
		\gls{antifragile} & \gls{antifragile} \gls{robust} \gls{resilient}\\%
		\gls{antifragile} \acrlong{ea}	& \gls{antifragile} public sector\\%
		\gls{antifragile} success factor & \gls{antifragile} \acrshort{vuca} \\%
		\gls{antifragile} system & \\%
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption[Antifragile keywords]{Antifragile keywords}
	\label{tab:antifragilekeywords}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{Enterprise Architecture}
\label{subsub:enterprisearchitecture}
As described earlier in the subsection \ref{sub:eathreeschools} the definition of the \acrfull{ea} school of \acrfull{eea} is the school that most likely that fits in with \gls{antifragility}. \textcite[p. 42]{Lapalme2012} states that there are seven dominant authors in the school of \acrshort{eea}.  The literature study on \acrshort{ea} will focus on these authors. These authors are:
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\textwidth}p{0.4\textwidth}}
		\toprule
		Jamshid Gharajedaghi & Tom Graves \\%
		Jan Hoogervorst	& James Martin \\%
		Kevin Smith & James Lapalme\\%
		Donald de Guerre &  \\%
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\acrfull{eea} authors \parencite[p.~42]{Lapalme2012}}
	\label{tab:eeaauthors}
\end{table}
For the literature study two sources are in focus. \textcite{Lapalme2012} on the three schools of \acrshort{ea}, \textcite{Lapalme2016} on the future of \acrshort{ea}, and \textcite{Graves2008} are used as a starting point of the literature study. The first method is snowballing. The two sources will be used for forward and backward snowballing. The second method for literature study is the use of online scientific libraries. For these libraries the following set of keywords and key sentences are used:
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\textwidth}p{0.4\textwidth}}
		\toprule
		\acrlong{ea} & \acrlong{ea} sucess factors\\%
		\acrlong{ea} \gls{antifragile} system	& \acrlong{ea} Business Strategy\\%
		\acrlong{ea} ecosystem & \acrlong{ea} Business Strategy\\%
		\acrlong{ea} public sector & \acrlong{ea} \acrlong{sie} \\%
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Enterprise Architecture keywords}
	\label{tab:enterprisearchitecturekeywords}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{Public sector}
\label{subsub:publicsector}
The literature study on public sector makes use of two primary sources. \textcite{Wal2008} is an article on the differences between the public and private sector based on the core values of these sectors. The second sources that is used is \textcite{Nurmi2021}. \textcite{Nurmi2021} is a dissertation thesis with the title \citetitle{Nurmi2021}. The concepts in the dissertation thesis of \citeauthor{Nurmi2021} uses some of the same concepts as this research. The only real differences are that it is not about \gls{antifragility} and that the case is about the Finnish \gls{ps}. These articles are used for forward and backward snowballing. The last method for literature study is the use of online scientific libraries. For these libraries the following set of keywords and key sentences are used:
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\textwidth}p{0.4\textwidth}}
		\toprule
		Difference public and private sector &	public sector \gls{antifragile}\\%
		Collaboration public and private sector & public sector \gls{resilient}\\%
		public sector \acrshort{vuca} & \\%
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Public sector keywords}
	\label{tab:publicsectorkeywords}
\end{table}
\subsection{Interviews}
\label{sub:interviews}
The interviews are in the format of semi-structured. A minimal set of questions is used because of time constraints. The set of questions is created by combining multiple attributes into one question. A \gls{conceptmap} is created to define which question will give a possible answer to what attribute. The \gls{conceptmap} is appended to the thesis, see \cref{app:cmapinterviewattributes}. Based on given answers, there will be further elaboration on the topic when there is a suspicion of extra information about \acrshort{ea} and \gls{antifragile} attributes. The interviews are recorded and transcribed. The transcriptions will be summarised and appended to this thesis, see \cref{app:interviewsummaries}. The transcriptions will be labeled with the earlier found attributes, \cref{sub:literaturestudy}, so that analysis can take place in a numerical form. The labeling will be done with a positive and a negative label. E.g. \textit{Antifragile} and \textit{Not Antifragile}. If the attribute is mentioned with a question per interview, it will only be counted once for that question for that interview. When an attribute is at least mentioned in 75\% of the interviews (cases) and the sum of the positive and negatives labels is equal or lower than 0 it could be a success factor. Newly found attributes are scored in the same way.
\subsection{Expert Group}
\label{sub:expertgroup}
The Expert Group is used to validate the findings from the interviews. Because the interviews already validated the initially found attributes the Expert Group will validate these for a second time. These findings are a subset of the original set found in the literature. The Expert Group is carefully composed of \acrshort{ea} specialists from the \gls{ps} with a balance between the governments and privately-held companies, all part of the public sector or \acrshort{ea} specialists with recent experience with the \gls{ps}. For the validation by the Expert Group, a meeting will be planned. All the known definitions and the agenda are shared with the Expert Group for preparation. The Group Support System Meeting Wizard supports this meeting. A presentation is used to bring the participants up to speed on the status of the research. Meeting Wizard will facilitate brainstorming for possible missed attributes, ordering the attributes and voting on the attributes. Meeting Wizard will also support surveys to determine the experience in \acrshort{ea} and the \gls{ps} and the relevance of the research. The output from the Expert Group will be analysed in the same way and with the same rules as that of the interviews. Everything must be normalised and be transformed into numeric values. The outcome of the Expert Group Validation will also trigger a second round of labelling the interviews for the new findings. 

\subsubsection{Analysis}
\label{subsub:analysis}
By combining the outcomes from the literature study, the interviews, and the Expert Group a list of attributes can be made that are most likely to be success factors that positively influence \acrshort{ea} in achieving \gls{antifragility} in the \gls{ps}.

\subsubsection{Conclusion and discussions}
\label{subsub:conclusionanddiscussions}

\section{Research type}
\label{sec:researchtype}
\begin{remark}
	Qualitative vs Quantitative! (use \parencite{Recker2013})
\end{remark}

\section{Research quality}
\label{sec:researchquality}
The quality attributes of \textcite[p.~15--17]{Recker2013} are used to increase the rigorousness of the research. The quality attributes of \textcite[p.~15--17]{Recker2013} are supported by the \textit{\acrfull{osf}} of \textcite{Foster2017}, the \textit{\gls{fair}} of \textcite[Box 2]{Wilkinson2016}, and the application of \textit{Triangulation}, \cref{sub:triangulation}.
\subsection{Quality attributes}
\label{sub:qualityattributes}
\textcite[p. 15-17]{Recker2013} suggests using four attributes to increase the quality of research. The first attribute that is defined by \textcite[p.~15]{Recker2013} is \textit{Replicability}. \textcite[p.~15]{Recker2013} characterises \textit{Replicability} as the extend to which research procedures are repeatable. The attribute states that the procedures by which research outputs are created should be conducted and documented in a manner that allows others outside the research team to independently repeat the procedures and obtain similar, if not identical, results \parencite[p.~15]{Recker2013}. The second attribute stated by \textcite[p.~16]{Recker2013} is \textit{Independence} which is closely related to reliability. \textit{Independence} concerns the extent to which the research conduct is impartial and freed from any subjective judgment or other bias stemming from the researcher or research team itself \parencite[p.~16]{Recker2013}. \textit{Precision} is the third attribute defined by \textcite[p.~16]{Recker2013}. According to \textcite[p.~16]{Recker2013} \textit{Precision} states that in all scientific research the concepts, constructs, and measurements should be as carefully and precisely defined as possible to allow others to use, apply, and challenge the definitions, concepts, and results in their own work. The last attribute that \textcite[p.~16]{Recker2013} mentions is \textit{Falsification}. \textit{Falsification} describes the logical possibility than an assertion, hypothesis, or theory can be contradicted by an observation or other outcome of a scientific study or experiment \parencite[p.~16]{Recker2013}. The quality attributes are operationalised in this research as described in \cref{tab:operationalisationofqualityattributes}.

\subsection{The FAIR Guiding Principles}
\label{sub:fairguidingprinciples}
In \citeyear{Wilkinson2016} \citetitle{Wilkinson2016} was published in Scientific Data\footnote{\url{https://www.nature.com/sdata/}} by \citeauthor{Wilkinson2016}. \textcite[p.~3]{Wilkinson2016} emphasised \textit{FAIR}ness being applied to both human-driven and machine-driven activities. \textcite[Box 2]{Wilkinson2016} intended to provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. These principles are also called the \gls{fair}. The \gls{fair} describe distinct considerations for contemporary data publishing environments concerning supporting both manual and automated deposition, exploration, sharing, and reuse \textcite[p.~4]{Wilkinson2016}. The first step in (re)using data is to find it \parencite[p.~1]{GOFAIR2017}. According to \textcite[p.~1]{GOFAIR2017} metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata is essential for the automatic discovery of datasets and services \parencite[p.~1]{GOFAIR2017}. \textit{Accessible} means that once the user finds the required data, it needs to know how it can be accessed \parencite[p.~1]{GOFAIR2017}. Accordingly to \textcite[p.~2]{GOFAIR2017} \textit{Interoperable} means that the data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing \parencite[p.~2]{GOFAIR2017}. The last guiding principle is stated by \textcite[p.~2]{GOFAIR2017} as \textit{Reusable}. Following \textcite[p.~2]{GOFAIR2017} the ultimate goal of the \gls{fair} is to optimise the reuse of data. Metadata and data should be well described so that they can be replicated and combined in different settings \parencite[p.~2]{GOFAIR2017}. The \gls{fair} are operationalised in the research as described in \cref{tab:fairguidingprincipilesoperationalised}.

		Findable & The thesis, research, and data sets contain keywords, links, structures, and meta data that can be indexed. \\%
		Accessible & The thesis, research and data sets are published on GitHub, Zenodo, and Researchgate based on Open Access. Objects are created containing a location where the data can be acquired if it cannot be published because of author rights. \\%
		Interoperable & This principle is least relevant for this research. The data sets are qualitative based on literature, interviews, Expert Group feedback, and surveys. The created data sets are available for analysis and are stored in structured Microsoft Excel files. The files are easy to import or reuse in other environments. \\%
		Reusable & The publication of the thesis, research and data sets are licensed under a \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/}{CC-BY-SA 4.0 license. The thesis, research, and data sets are allowed to be shared and adapted (commercially) as long as the original author is attributed and the possible derivate is published under the same license.} \\%

\subsection{The Open Science Framework}
\label{sub:osf}
The \gls{ps} is the context of this research. \Gls{socialresponsbility} is important for this sector. To support \gls{socialresponsbility} this research and thesis are based on \gls{openscience}. \textcite{UNESCO2020} states that the idea behind Open Science is to allow scientific information, data and outputs to be more widely accessible (Open Access) and more reliably harnessed (Open Data) with the active engagement of all the stakeholders (Open to Society). The Center for Open Science\footnote{{\url{https://www.cos.io/}}} supports this way of research by supplying guidelines and a toolkit. For this research, the \gls{openscience} framework is used to support Open Access, Open Data and Open to Society. One of the tools in the framework is a reference model to select tools for the four main phases of research: Search and Discover, Design Study, Collect and Analyse Data, and Publish Reports, \cref{fig:openscienceframework}.

\subsection{Triangulation}
\label{sub:triangulation}
\Gls{triangulation} has its origins in geography. To know the position of a distant object, two checkpoints are needed. The mutual distance between the calibration points and the angles relative to the object make it possible to calculate the correct distance via triangulation\footnote{\url{https://www.britannica.com/science/triangulation-trigonometry}} \parencite[p.~88]{Mortelmans2018}. Following \textcite[p.~88]{Recker2013} \gls{triangulation} literally means doing more than just one thing \parencite[p.~88]{Recker2013}. According to \textcite[p.~110]{Recker2013} \gls{triangulation} means you are seeking convergence and corroboration of results from different methods and designs studying the same phenomenon. Through \gls{triangulation}, the researcher can gain a more nuanced picture of the situation and increase the reliability and validity of their findings \parencite[p.~88]{Recker2013}. \textcite[p.~88]{Recker2013} states that the use of \gls{triangulation} assists researchers in increasing the \gls{robustness} of results. Findings can be strengthened through the cross-validation achieved when different kinds and sources of data converge and are found to be congruent \parencite[p.~88]{Recker2013}. \textcite[p.~207]{Saunders2015} states that \gls{triangulation} involves using more than one source of data and method of collection to confirm the validity, credibility, and authenticity of research data, analysis and interpretation. \textcite[p.~207]{Saunders2015} also stresses that it is a necessity to use \textit{\gls{triangulation}} for a multi-method quantitative study, multi-method qualitative study or a mixed-methods study.

\textcite[p.~481]{Mortelmans2018} explains that in the qualitative research tradition, \gls{triangulation} has become the method of choice for increasing the credibility of results. It is stated by \textcite[p.~481]{Mortelmans2018} that there are four types of \gls{triangulation}. According to \textcite[p.~88]{Mortelmans2018} the first type is that of \textit{Data \Gls{triangulation}}. \textcite[p.~481]{Mortelmans2018} states that with \textit{Data \Gls{triangulation}}, different types of data are collected. The condition here is that the researcher stays within the qualitative paradigm \parencite[p.~481]{Mortelmans2018}. \textcite[p.~481]{Mortelmans2018} defines the second type \textit{Researcher \Gls{triangulation}}. To avoid case contamination, multiple researchers analyse the same data \parencite[p.~482]{Mortelmans2018}. Afterwards, the results are compared with each other, and it is examined where any differences come from \parencite[p.~482]{Mortelmans2018}. The third case is defined by \textcite[p.~481]{Mortelmans2018} as \textit{Theory \Gls{triangulation}}. \textcite[p.~482]{Mortelmans2018} explains that \textit{Theoretical \Gls{triangulation}} means triangulating the results from different theoretical angles. Looking at data from a different perspective often yields compelling \parencite[p.~482]{Mortelmans2018}. The last type of \gls{triangulation} is defined by \textcite[p.~481]{Mortelmans2018} as \textit{Methodological \Gls{triangulation}}. According to \textcite[p.~483]{Mortelmans2018} explains \textit{Methodological \Gls{triangulation}} as the combination of data collected by qualitative technique with data collected by quantitative means. However, \textcite[p.~483]{Mortelmans2018}\textit{Methodological \Gls{triangulation}} explains it does not necessarily mean that quantitative methods are applied in research.

Triangulation is operationalised as Methodological Triangulation by using, as visualised by \cref{fig:triangulation}, literature study to abstract attributes, interviews with data analysis to validate attributes and an expert group with data analysis to validate attributes.






\section{Research infrastructure and tooling}
\label{sec:researchinfraandtooling}

For selecting the suitable instruments for the research, the Open Science Framework\footnote{\url{https://www.cos.io/products/osf}} is used, see \cref{fig:openscienceframework}. The Open Science Framework proposes specific infrastructure and tools per stage. The transparency in the used infrastructure and tools increases the quality of the research by increasing replicability, findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.

\subsection{Thesis creation}
\label{sub:tbresearchcreation}
I used my corporate laptop (Dell Latitude 7200 2-in-1\footnote{\url{https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/latitude-7200-2-in-1-laptop/spd/latitude-12-7200-2-in-1-laptop}}) with Windows 10 Professional installed for creating the thesis. The thesis is created with the markup language \LaTeX\footnote{\url{https://www.latex-project.org/}}. The used typesetting environment is TexLive\footnote{\url{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}} with the document type of ''Report'' from KOMA-Script\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/koma-script}}. TexStudio\footnote{\url{https://www.texstudio.org/}} is the used \LaTeX\ Editor. It supports syntax-highlighting, has an integrated viewer, reference checking and numerous wizards. For the creation and administration of references Bib\LaTeX\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex/}} is used with the reference manager JabRef\footnote{\url{https://www.jabref.org/}} with the citation style of APA 7th Edition\footnote{\url{https://apastyle.apa.org/}} and with web browser integration. The files are stored on a personal Dropbox\footnote{\url{https://www.dropbox.com/}} that is used by GitHub Desktop\footnote{\url{https://desktop.github.com/}} to synchronise with a public GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JRBliekendaal/master-thesis}}. GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/}} is used for source control but also for reviewing and discussing the topics with my (Co-)Promotor and the planning of the master thesis project. The thesis source files are copied to an Amazon S3 Blob\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/s3/}} for backup. The backup rotation is seven versions. Cloudberry Explorer Freeware for Amazon S3\footnote{\url{https://www.msp360.com/explorer/windows/amazon-s3.aspx}} is used for backup. Grammarly\footnote{\url{https://www.grammarly.com}}, with the paid subscription service, checks the thesis for spelling, grammar,  style, and plagiarism. The used goals for Grammarly are audience=knowledgeable, formality=formal, and domain=academic. Microsoft Visio Professional\footnote{\url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/visio/}} is used to create figures. The GitHub repository contains all the sources\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JRBliekendaal/master-thesis/tree/main/images/sources}}.
\subsection{Research administration}
\label{sub:tbresearchadministration}
The research administration, which includes documentation containing privacy-sensitive information, like the name and contact information of the Expert Group participants, is stored on a non-public GitHub Repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JRBliekendaal/master-thesis-administration}}. The private GitHub Repository is also for staging thesis parts that still need to be anonymised. For taking notes Leuchtturm1917\footnote{\url{https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-classic.html}} Notebooks are used a mechanical pencil of Rotring\footnote{\url{https://www.rotring.com/pens-pencils/pencils/rotring-600-mechanical-pencil-1/SAP_1904443.html}}.
\subsection{Research execution}
\label{sub:tbresearchexecution}
For the execution of the research, Microsoft Excel\footnote{\url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel}} is used for the administration of the literature research. For the administration of the literature research, the following headers are used: ID (for a unique ID per item), search terms used, scope, title, subtitle, author(s), year, type, Bib\LaTeX\ citation key, title relevance, abstract relevance, content relevance, found at, doi/isbn, url, date found, duplicate, date used, use for, and notes. Researchgate\footnote{\url{https://www.researchgate.net/}}, Web of Science\footnote{\url{https://app.webofknowledge.com/}}, Google Scholar\footnote{\url{https://scholar.google.com/}}, and Semantic Scholar\footnote{\url{https://www.semanticscholar.org/}} are the main sources for searching for literature. PaperPanda\footnote{\url{https://paperpanda.app/}} is used for hard to find literature. The literature administration is, together with the publicly available literature, stored in the repository of the master thesis\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JRBliekendaal/master-thesis/tree/main/literature}}. For non-public available literature, the administration contains the location where the literature is retrievable. All the literature is added to a bib\LaTeX\ file for future reference. For traceability the entries in the bib\LaTeX\ file contain the Unique ID in the notes field. JabRef is used to sort the references by using subgroups to support the workflow. The subgroups used are: ''evaluate, rejected, and used.'' Only the literature in the subgroup used are transferred to the bibliography file of the thesis. This prevents cluttering. For working as paperless as possible all the literature, where possible, is in pdf or in ebook format. For reading Acrobat Reader DC\footnote{\url{https://get.adobe.com/reader/}} is used for reading the PDF, and an Amazon Kindle Oasis\footnote{\url{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L5GJD99}} for eBooks. With the Amazon Kindle the highlight feature is used. This is not stored on GitHub since the highlights are under copyright of the author(s). For interviews Microsoft Teams is used with the transcript and session recording functionality. The transcript is full of sensitive information and is not publicly available. To make sure that the necessary information is available summaries are created and added to the thesis. The recordings are securely stored and are available upon request by the Antwerp Management School. The transcripts are used in QDA Minder Lite\footnote{\url{https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/freeware/}} to label the interviews so that analysis can be done with Microsoft Excel. For the Expert Group, Meetingwizard\footnote{\url{https://www.meetingwizard.nl/}} is used for brainstorming, surveys and voting. The license for using Meeting Wizard is supplied by the Antwerp Management School. The output of the meetingwizard session is stored as an Microsoft Excel file in the repository of the thesis (anomysed).
