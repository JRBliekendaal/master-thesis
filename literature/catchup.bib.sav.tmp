   emphasis does not acknowledge the overlap between resilience and
   associated but distinctly different concepts like robustness and
   antifragility as observable phenomena in organizational responses to
   adversity. To extend Hillmann and Guenther's work, we therefore
   conceptually contrast resilience with robustness and antifragility so

   residual causality, where software design decisions made long ago in
   different circumstances for different reasons constrain human action in
   an unknown future. The less aware the designers of software systems are
   of complexity in social systems, the more likely they are to introduce
   residual causality. The introduction of intricate, ordered machines, to
   a world largely defined by disorder and heuristics, has caused
   philosophical perturbations that we have not fully dealt with. The
   machine in the ghost is the belief that machine thinking can be applied
   to the environment in which the machine will operate. As
   hyperconnectivity increases, the ghost becomes more unpredictable,
   unmanageable, and even less like the machine. If we continue to indulge
   the machine view of the world, the design of software systems presents
   real dangers to the autonomy of the individual and the functioning of
   our societies. The steadfastness of machine ontologies in the
   philosophies of software architects risks creating increasing residual
   causality as hyperconnectivity increases. Shifting the philosophical
   position of software architects opens up the possibility of discovering
   new methods that make it easier to avoid these dangers.}},

   alternative way seeks to live with, and to benefit from, uncertainty by
   using ideas derived from exploration, effectuation, antifragility and
   `trial and error'. This paper compares the two approaches and considers
   their rationales and potential effectiveness. It suggests that
   forecasting and planning has many drawbacks and is often not the best
   way to operate in uncertain conditions. Nevertheless, it is often
   advocated and its thinking seems to have been adopted as the default
   philosophy for business. Therefore if, as has been suggested,
   uncertainty is the norm, do we need to advocate adopting a different way
   of thinking?}},

   theory assumes that the likelihood, order, and scale of impact of these
   stressors cannot be known in advance in any sufficiently complex system,
   and that these properties are never static across time as any stressor
   impact means that the system has changed. Residuality theory argues for
   the designers of software systems using residues as the building blocks
   of system design as opposed to components or processes. The result of
   residual analysis is a structure that does not depend on the individual
   pieces that made it up, (in fact the system may not survive some of the
   initial stressors used to inform its design) but on the overall ability
   of the system to respond to unknown stressors - the whole should be seen
   to be more than the sum of its parts. The ability to survive stress that
   the system is not designed for is considered to move the system toward
   antifragility {[}2]. This article investigates the philosophical
   assumptions behind these ideas and compares and contrasts them with
   those of conventional practices within software architecture (C) 2021

   quality needs. Quality assurance activities are aimed at ensuring such
   quality requirements of the software system. Antifragility is a property
   of software that increases its quality as a result of errors, faults,
   and attacks. Such antifragile software systems proactively accepts the
   errors and learns from these errors and relies on test-driven
   development methodology. In this article, an innovative approach is
   proposed which uses a fault injection methodology to perform the task of
   quality assurance. Such a fault injection mechanism makes the software
   antifragile and it gets better with the increase in the intensity of
   such errors up to a point. A software quality game is designed as a
   two-player game model with stressor and backer entities. The stressor is
   an error model which injects errors into the software system. The
   software system acts as a backer, and tries to recover from the errors.
   The backer uses a cheating mechanism by implementing software Learning
   Hooks (SLH) which learn from the injected errors. This makes the
   software antifragile and leads to improvement of the code. Moreover, the
   SLH uses a Q-Learning reinforcement algorithm with a hybrid reward
   function to learn from the incoming defects. The game is played for a
   maximum of K errors. This approach is introduced to incorporate the
   anti-fragility aspects into the software system within the existing
   framework of object-oriented development. The game is run at the end of
   every increment during the construction of object-oriented systems. A
   detailed report of the injected errors and the actions taken is output
   at the end of each increment so that necessary actions are incorporated
   into the actual software during the next iteration. This ensures at the
   end of all the iterations, the software is immune to majority of the
   so-called Black Swans. The experiment is conducted with an open source
   Java sample and the results are studied selected two categories of
   evaluation parameters. The defect related performance parameters
   considered are the defect density, defect distribution over different
   iterations, and number of hooks inserted. These parameters show much
   reduction in adopting the proposed approach. The quality parameters such
   as abstraction, inheritance, and coupling are studied for various
   iterations and this approach ensures considerable increases in these
   parameters.}},

   socio-economic systems and are frequently difficult to predict
   beforehand but easy to explain afterwards. Antifragile systems can
   withstand and benefit from this kind of outlier events, whereas merely
   robust systems cannot in any case. Yet the aim to design robust systems
   is almost as old as the system dynamics field itself. This research
   therefore aims to investigate the extent to which an antifragile system
   design criterion is more valuable than a robust one. By means of an
   extensive literature review, a simulation model was constructed, which
   is demonstrated to be antifragile. Comparing the antifragile and robust
   versions of the model shows that the former-as theorized-yields more
   favourable results in an environment with impactful outlier events.
   Implementing antifragility in systems involves the difficult task of
   changing policies (and, eventually, the mental models) of
   decision-makers. Consequently, this research concludes that
   antifragility should not and cannot always be attained; its feasibility
   is to be assessed at the start of a system dynamics modelling project.}},

   paramount for guaranteeing appropriate risk taking, enabling innovators

   Taleb has proposed the Barbell strategy, characterised by maximal

   uncertainty on the other extreme, as a means for developing
   anti-fragility, i.e., ability to gain from disorder. In this paper, we
   propose our vision consisting of a Barbell strategy-oriented regulatory
   framework and compliance management, where regulators and
   manufacturers/innovators, both, adopt a Barbell strategy for reaching an
   optimal solution in regulatory making, the former, and compliance
   management, the latter. Finally, conclusion and perspectives for future

   resilient and antifragile behaviour through understanding sensitivity to
   stress and the concept of residual behaviours. By considering systems as
   a set of residues that exist in connection to stressors, we can more
   easily understand the role of design decisions in the life cycle of
   software systems and the unpredictable complex contexts they exist in.
   Residuality theory provides an alternative to the vague methods by which
   OOP, SOA, and microservice approaches arrive at system designs and most
   importantly places non-functional properties as first class citizens of
   design efforts. Residuality theory allows us to consider business,
   software, and infrastructure architecture across many different
   platforms and paradigms and allows us to describe architecture in the
   same way regardless of perspective. It allows us to describe approaches
   both for functional and non-functional requirements and for design,
   delivery and operation of applications. Residuality Theory paves the way
   for expressing architectures as mathematical structures which makes
   approaches like Model Based Systems Engineering {[}1] possible. (C) 2020

   theory of chaos in the process of managing the industrial enterprises.
   One of the tools for managing chaos is proposed to be chaos engineering
   - a method of conducting planned experiments that give an idea of how
   the system can behave as a result of disturbances. The introduction of
   chaos engineering will allow for prediction of possible perturbations
   and prepare the system for a new attractor at an optimal time with
   minimal losses. The chaos management model of the economic system, which
   allows either a radical change in the status of the enterprise, its
   ability to influence demand and supply while maintaining the
   subjectivity of the development, or to promote antifragility of the
   enterprise, allows strengthening the stability of the economic system.}},

  abstract                   = {{The confusion surrounding the role of architecture when aiming for
   Agility isn't simply a labored talking point it's part of the reason
   Agile initiatives fail, and architecture teams are losing influence. In
   a recent survey conducted by IASA Global of 260 organizations, greater
   than 75\% were implementing some form of Agile practice, 50\% of the 260
   were implementing agile at scale. Of those who responded, less than 50\%
   have integrated architecture into their agile process. As it stands, it
   appears agile \& architecture are struggling to find a fit. This paper
   considers the possible impacts of a third way - Agility through
   Antifragility. Rather than aiming to control, or to remove control, we
   seek to build systems, both technical and business, that aim to be
   Antifragile to change. This allows the production of business and
   technical architectures that actually enable Agility through design
   rather than process or `mindset'. Taking ideas from Systems Engineering,
   and Complexity Science, and data from IASA's 2018 Architecture Survey,
   we explore how the inherent interconnectedness of architecture and
   Agility can be leveraged to make the management of complexity something
   all organizations can do. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   approach to cope with disruptions. A brief overview of existing
   strategies as potential building blocks for resilience and antifragility
