However, hardly any quantitative data about the value of IT architecture is available. This paper presents the results of a study, which measures the value of IT solution architecture for software development projects. The study identifies ten architecture-related project-variables and correlates these with eight project success variables. Statistical analysis of 49 IT projects shows that the use of solution architecture is correlated with decreased budget and time overrun, increased reliability of project planning and increased customer satisfaction. The results of the study indicate that IT usage of solution architecture for custom software development projects leads to better project results. Also the limitations of the study are discussed.},

It views the technical solutions and their stakeholders as complex adaptive systems and argues that traditional risk analyses cannot predict all future incidents with major impacts. To avoid unacceptable events, it is necessary to establish and operate anti-fragile ICT systems that limit the impact of all incidents, and which learn from small-impact incidents how to function increasingly well in changing environments. The book applies four design principles and one operational principle to achieve anti-fragility for different classes of incidents. It discusses how systems can achieve high availability, prevent malware epidemics, and detect anomalies. Analyses of Netflix’s media streaming solution, Norwegian telecom infrastructures, e-government platforms, and Numenta’s anomaly detection software show that cloud computing is essential to achieving anti-fragility for classes of events with negative impacts.},

  abstract     = {Systems theory has been challenged in the recent literature due to its perceived disconnection from today’s research and practice demands. Moving away from the reductionist frameworks and the complicated domain predominated by known unknowns and order, a call is being made to the social sciences to begin adopting complexity theory and newer connectionist methods that better address complexity and open social systems. Scholars and scholar-practitioners will continue to find the need to apply complexity theory as wicked problems become more prevalent in the social sciences. This paper differentiates between general systems theory (GST) and complexity theory, as well as identifies advantages for the social sciences in incorporating complexity theory as a formal theory. Complexity theory is expanded upon and identified as providing a new perspective and a new method of theorizing that can be practiced by disciplines within the social sciences. These additions could better position the social sciences to address the complexity associated with advancing technology, globalization, intricate markets, cultural change, and the myriad of challenges and opportunities to come.},

  abstract   = {Resilience has, in the past four decades, been a term increasingly employed throughout a number of sciences: psychology and ecology, most prominently. Increasingly one finds it in political science, business administration, sociology, history, disaster planning, urban planning, and international development. The shared use of the term does not, however, imply unified concepts of resilience nor the theories in which it is embedded. Different uses generate different methods, sometimes different methodologies. Evidential or other empirical support can differ between domains of application, even when concepts are broadly shared. The review centres on three resilience frameworks, of increasing complexity: Engineering Resilience (or ‘Common Sense’ resilience); Systems Resilience, called Robustness in economics; and Resilience in Complex Adaptive Systems. Although each framework has historical roots in particular disciplines, the frameworks themselves can be applied to any domain: Engineering Resilience is utilised in some child development studies; Systems Resilience is often used in governance and management; and the Complex Adaptive Systems approach has been applied to economics, innovation in technology, history, and urban planning. Thus different frameworks along the spectrum offer a choice of perspective; the acceptability of trade-offs between them, and not subject matter, will ultimately determine which perspective is chosen.},

• Record M\&A activity and the growth of startups with multi-billion dollar valuations are leading indicators that a period of relative stability is ending and that an increasing number of corporate leaders will lose control of their firm’s future.
• A storm warning to executives: at our forecasted churn rate, about half of the S\&P 500 will be replaced over the next 10 years.
• In a related survey on strategic readiness, executives say that growth strategy is being undermined by day-to-day decisions inside companies and that too many companies lack a coherent vision of the future.},

  abstract     = {Nassim Taleb's antifragile concept has been shown considerable interest in the media and on the Internet recently. For Taleb, the antifragile concept is a blueprint for living in a black swan world (where surprising extreme events may occur), the key being to love variation and uncertainty to some degree, and thus also errors. The antonym of “fragile” is not robustness or resilience, but “please mishandle” or “please handle carelessly,” using an example from Taleb when referring to sending a package full of glasses by post. In this article, we perform a detailed analysis of this concept, having a special focus on how the antifragile concept relates to common ideas and principles of risk management. The article argues that Taleb's antifragile concept adds an important contribution to the current practice of risk analysis by its focus on the dynamic aspects of risk and performance, and the necessity of some variation, uncertainties, and risk to achieve improvements and high performance at later stages.},

  abstract     = {{VUCA} is an acronym that has recently found its way into the business lexicon. The components it refers to—volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity—are words that have been variously used to describe an environment which defies confident diagnosis and befuddles executives. In a ‘{VUCA} world,’ both pundits and executives have said, core activities essential to driving organizational performance—like strategic planning—are viewed as mere exercises in futility. {VUCA} conditions render useless any efforts to understand the future and to plan responses. When leaders are left with little to do other than wring their hands, organizational performance quickly falls at risk. In this installment of Organizational Performance, we demonstrate that by overlooking important differences in the conditions that volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity describe, we have disempowered leaders. We show how leaders can appreciate the differences among each of these challenging situations in order to properly allocate scarce resources to preserve and enhance organizational performance.},

While methods and models for describing and analyzing enterprise architectures (EA) have been extensively discussed, principles guiding an EA’s design and evolution are hardly covered in existing research. The paper at hand therefore analyzes the mechanisms of EA principles (EAP), that is EAP grounding, EAP management, and EAP guidance and their effects on EA consistency and EAM utility. Specifically we aim at understanding the role of organizational culture for the mechanisms and effects of EAP. Based on empirical data we find that all relations describing EAP mechanisms and their effects are significantly moderated by organizational culture. Based on our findings we give recommendations on how to deal with selected design decisions when introducing and developing EA principles in an organization.},

In large-scale agile settings, multiple development activities need to be coordinated to achieve desirable enterprise-wide effects and agility. A powerful instrument to effectively guide and steer large-scale agile endeavors is the formulation and usage of architecture principles. Despite their raison d'être to guide large organizational transformations, extant studies on how principles can be used to support large-scale agile transformations are still lacking. Against this backdrop, we present a multiple-case study involving five German companies that aims to shed light on the establishment of architecture principles to support large-scale agile transformations. Based on our results from sixteen semi-structured interviews, we present current practices as well as challenges faced by organizations during the application of architecture principles. In addition, we show a set of principles used to support large-scale agile transformations.},

In this paper we investigate the regulative nature of enterprise architecture. We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of the regulative needs that underly an enterprise architecture, and then take these needs as a starting point to arrive at requirements on the language (architecture principles) used to denote enterprise architectures. We furthermore discuss the process of formulating principles as well as their semantics.},

  abstract     = {The sustainability of regional development can be usefully explored through several different lenses. In situations in which uncertainties and change are key features of the ecological landscape and social organization, critical factors for sustainability are resilience, the capacity to cope and adapt, and the conservation of sources of innovation and renewal. However, interventions in social-ecological systems with the aim of altering resilience immediately confront issues of governance. Who decides what should be made resilient to what? For whom is resilience to be managed, and for what purpose? In this paper we draw on the insights from a diverse set of case studies from around the world in which members of the Resilience Alliance have observed or engaged with sustainability problems at regional scales. Our central question is: How do certain attributes of governance function in society to enhance the capacity to manage resilience? Three specific propositions were explored: (1) participation builds trust, and deliberation leads to the shared understanding needed to mobilize and self-organize; (2) polycentric and multilayered institutions improve the fit between knowledge, action, and social-ecological contexts in ways that allow societies to respond more adaptively at appropriate levels; and (3) accountable authorities that also pursue just distributions of benefits and involuntary risks enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups and society as a whole. Some support was found for parts of all three propositions. In exploring the sustainability of regional social-ecological systems, we are usually faced with a set of ecosystem goods and services that interact with a collection of users with different technologies, interests, and levels of power. In this situation in our roles as analysts, facilitators, change agents, or stakeholders, we not only need to ask: The resilience of what, to what? We must also ask: For whom?},

This has been termed by Taleb (2012) as 'antifragility'. This paper explores the benefits of applying a systems approach to service delivery design in order to build an 'antifragile' organisation that can learn from disruptions. Two exploratory case studies were conducted in the UK insurance sector using in-depth interviews supported by documented evidence. The findings of the case studies analysis suggest that systems approach expressed as the Vanguard method (Seddon, 2003) is likely to enhance organisational 'antifragility' by promoting a multilevel driver for learning from stressors. These levels being: 1) the macro level of clarity on the system due to the continuous analysis of customer demands received; 2) the meso level of organic structure of work place where effective learning-centred teams are built; 3) the micro level of employees' engagement with work and readiness to learn. This paper represents an early effort to explore the dynamics of how organisations can go beyond resilience by discovering how to develop the capacity to learn from stressors in order to flourish.},

  abstract     = {The concept of resilience has evolved considerably since Holling's (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system's dynamics. Three related attributes of social-ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components-latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy-most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable. The implications of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance.},

  title    = {Attributes relevant to antifragile organizations},
  abstract = {Organizations operate in a socio-economic context,
and alignment with this context is key for business success. The
rate of change and impact of these changes on the operating
model of the organization appears to be increasing. Major trends
are the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, the “VUCA”
aspects (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity), and the
Covid-pandemic. The challenge for organizations is to become
resilient or even antifragile to survive (unexpected) external
stressors.
Antifragility refers to a class of systems that do not deteriorate
(fragile) or withstand (robust) stressors, but actually improve as
a result of stressors. Our objective is to find attributes that are
relevant for an organization to be(come) antifragile. The list of
attributes found is based on an extensive survey of available
literature, and is validated with domain experts and leaders of
various organizations. We dub the list of attributes found the
Extended Antifragile Attribute List (EAAL).
Considering the current economic and social impact on organizations
and people of the Covid-pandemic, the EAAL is relevant
as well timely. The EAAL turns out to be extensive and holistic.
We consider the EAAL to be a stepping stone in setting the scene
of the domain of antifragility.
We suspect that the EAAL might also be applied to generic
system design including technology infrastructure and software
systems. This exploration is part of future research.�},

  abstract     = {Residuality theory [1] states that the future of a system is a function of its residues - the leftovers of the system after the impact of a stressor. A stressor is anything that is previously unseen or unknown that impacts the system. A system is said to be residual when its design is expressed in terms of residues and stressors. Residuality theory assumes that the likelihood, order, and scale of impact of these stressors cannot be known in advance in any sufficiently complex system, and that these properties are never static across time as any stressor impact means that the system has changed. Residuality theory argues for the designers of software systems using residues as the building blocks of system design as opposed to components or processes. The result of residual analysis is a structure that does not depend on the individual pieces that made it up, (in fact the system may not survive some of the initial stressors used to inform its design) but on the overall ability of the system to respond to unknown stressors - the whole should be seen to be more than the sum of its parts. The ability to survive stress that the system is not designed for is considered to move the system toward antifragility [2].

By considering systems as a set of residues that exist in connection to stressors, we can more easily understand the role of design decisions in the life cycle of software systems and the unpredictable complex contexts they exist in. Residuality theory provides an alternative to the vague methods by which OOP, SOA, and microservice approaches arrive at system designs and most importantly places non-functional properties as first class citizens of design efforts. Residuality theory allows us to consider business, software, and infrastructure architecture across many different platforms and paradigms and allows us to describe architecture in the same way regardless of perspective. It allows us to describe approaches both for functional and non-functional requirements and for design, delivery and operation of applications. Residuality Theory paves the way for expressing architectures as mathematical structures which makes approaches like Model Based Systems Engineering [1] possible.},

Due to pervasiveness of software in a growing number of mission critical applications, traditional resilience and recovery systems may not be sufficient. Software has taken over many functionalities which are of vital interest in today and future world. We relay a lot on software applications which may be faulty and cause immense damages. To cope with this scenario, claiming to develop better software is not enough, since unexpected events a.k.a. Black Swans, may disrupt and overcome our system. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new architectural design that responds to the need to build antifragile systems for contemporary complex scenarios. We suggest a system which enhances its strength through experience and errors. It is a self adaptive system architecture improving when facing errors. The most relevant aspect of this approach is that architectures are not only resilient, they extract the intrinsic value of faults. This paper suggests that a fine grained architecture is the key issue to build antifragile systems.},

This Manifesto does not want to be a fixed and complete set of principles. It is an open contribution to the discussion which needs to be improved and re-elaborated.

Often, the approach will be relatively static and the aim will be to mitigate the analysed risks as this is the easiest way to verify the safety property. Antifragile systems [10] however are defined as systems that adapt after a fault occurs and are not only resilient but also learn from faults and incidents to improve their delivered service level.

  abstract     = {While technology has made astounding advances in the last century, problems are confronting the engineering community that must be solved. Cost and schedule of producing large systems are increasing at an unsustainable rate and these systems often do not perform as intended. New systems are required that may not be achieved by current methods. To solve these problems, NASA is working to infuse concepts from Complexity Science into the engineering process. Some of these problems may be solved by a change in design philosophy. Instead of designing systems to meet known requirements that will always lead to fragile systems at some degree, systems should be designed wherever possible to be antifragile: designing cognitive cyber-physical systems that can learn from their experience, adapt to unforeseen events they face in their environment, and grow stronger in the face of adversity. Several examples are presented of on ongoing research efforts to employ this philosophy.},
